About package "spec"
=============

Package spec provides descriptive and flexible wrappers of the "testing"
package. It can be used along with command Gotest, or with the companion
command [Gospec](https://github.com/bmatsuo/go-spec/tree/master/gospec#readme).

"spec" is meant to make writing comprehensive unit testing easier to manage
with Go. The "testing" package and Gotest are pretty good for out-of-the-box
functionality. But managing a large project with them is not very feasible.
Obviously inspired by Ruby's RSpec gem, GoSpec is used to write nested
specifications which test as well as describe the functionality of programs,
workflows, and objects.
